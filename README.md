# 🏦 Bank System in C++

## 📌 Overview
This is my **first Object-Oriented Programming project in C++**.  
It’s a simple **Bank System** that applies OOP concepts and basic file handling (used in the login system).  

This project marks the completion of my **C++ basics + OOP learning phase**, and also my first step into working with **files for storing user data**.

## 🎯 Features
✔️ Add, delete, and update clients  
✔️ User login & management (**with file handling**)  
✔️ Transactions (deposit, withdraw, transfer, balance inquiry)  
✔️ Currency exchange  
✔️ Menu-based interface with sub-menus  
✔️ Use of simple system commands (`system("cls")`, `system("pause")`) for console control
